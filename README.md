# Repair My 'Ship

**The Idea:** This is short for â€œRepair My Relationshipâ€. It is a forum where users can post about their relationship issues, and others can chime in with advice on how to fix their problems.

If you have experienced the fine communities on sites like 4chan, Reddit or Bodybuilding.com, then you know that there are plenty of people willing to donate a few minutes of time to help out.

**Type of Site:** Forum

### Key Functions:

- A post/comment system similar to Reddit or Quora.
- An upvote system for both posts and comments
- An opportunity for the user to post what they actually tried with their significant other, and what results ensued
- A badges or karma system to reward frequently upvoted users
- A user account system for those that want to comment or post, similar to Reddit

### Key Feature Decisions:

- Should this be more anonymized like Reddit, or tied to a social media account like Quora for credibility?
- There will be plenty of trolls on this site. How do you deal with it?
- Should this strictly relate to romantic relationships? Or friendships as well?
- How can you use the badge system to motivate especially good commenters to come back?
- What You Will Learn: How to build a forum! Also, there are plenty of people out there that are willing to donate a few minutes of their time to help Internet strangers in need. Seriously.
- Your main challenge is making sure these helpful users feel rewarded for their efforts, because that will motivate them to come back.
